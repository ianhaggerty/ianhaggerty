### Hey There World! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!

I've done my best to keep things organised here...

You can find plenty of weird and wonderful creations.

- CLI Apps
- Websites
- CSS Projects
- Data Science
- NLP!
- Machine learning

So have a poke around!

If you like what you see, give me a PM. ðŸ’¬
 
Perhaps we can build something together? ðŸ‘¯
